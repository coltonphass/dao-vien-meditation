                  <p>
                    "Before I started coming to the English meditation class, I
                    had already developed a home meditation practice that I kept
                    up for a few years. But something inside me began nudging me
                    to sit with others. I didn’t know what I was looking for
                    exactly (maybe a sense of shared peace), but I found the
                    center online and decided to give it a try, even though I
                    wasn’t sure if language would be a barrier. From the very
                    first visit, I felt something I didn’t expect: a gentle
                    sense of belonging. The grounds are beautiful, the center
                    itself feels like a refuge, and the energy of the people is
                    calm, joyful, and full of warmth. It doesn’t feel like
                    someone teaching a class to you, it feels like we’re
                    learning with one another. It feels equal. Safe. Nourishing.
                    Each class begins with meditation, and it rotates between
                    sitting, walking, standing, and laying down. We also learn
                    beautiful practices like the five earth touchings and
                    reflect on the four foundations of mindfulness. The teacher,
                    Sister Hanh Vien, leads with kindness and clarity, making
                    the space feel grounded and welcoming. I especially love the
                    rice tea and learning that even having tea can be a
                    meditation. Since attending the class, I’ve noticed
                    something subtle but powerful happening within me. My
                    nervous system feels more settled. I’m more aware throughout
                    my day, not just during meditation. And one of the best
                    changes I’m experiencing is that I don’t feel the same need
                    to react emotionally to every moment. There’s more room
                    inside me now for peace, softness, and love. Even parenting
                    has shifted for me, it feels lighter, calmer, and happier.
                    To anyone curious about coming, I say: absolutely try it.
                    Just come as you are. You don’t have to know everything or
                    do anything perfectly. The peace you’ve been looking for
                    might be waiting for you here. "

                    "I was hesitant to step into a new environment, especially
                    in the realm of meditation, but choosing to do so was one of
                    the best decisions I’ve ever made. Tu Vien Dao Vien and its
                    community welcomed me like family, regardless of my
                    religion, race, or background. Through their practice, I’ve
                    found greater peace with life and with the things I cannot
                    control, and I’ve learned healthier ways to cope with my
                    OCD. They never ask for anything in return. no money, no
                    obligations, just genuine kindness and love. For me, Tu Vien
                    Dao Vien has truly become a second home and a path to
                    liberation."
